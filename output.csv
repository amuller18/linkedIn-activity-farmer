10,"I see many guides and examples of using ChatGPT and Claude for CV screening, from AI influencers, HR Tech professionals and startups building on top of LLMs. This is awful. Most guides go like this:- Copy the job description- Copy 3-5 parsed resumes- Write a detailed prompt asking GPT to compare the profiles to the job description.- Paste all these in GPT and save tons of time with the results.This is a bit concerning for a few reasons:- This is probably illegal in quite a few countries, because LLMs are black boxes and there is no explainability or interpretability as to how the screening results are generated- LLMs get worse with extended context, so pasting 10-20 pages of text decreases the quality of response and parts of your prompt will be cut off anyway with GPT3.5.- Bias – LLMs are trained on vast datasets that inevitably contain biases present in the source material – this has been shown multiple times in different studies, including recruiting cases.- Sharing candidate private data with GPT without their consentWith some advanced implementation, specific problems above can be fixed, like removing personal data or using advanced models to reduce context limitation size.However, the worst problem here is a fundamental lack of understanding of how LLMs work. The absence of real-world awareness or common sense reasoning in LLMs is a critical drawback in screening profiles.While LLMs can process and generate text based on patterns, they do not understand the text in the human sense. Their ""understanding"" is limited to statistical correlations between words and phrases in their training data. LLMs operate strictly within the scope of the text data on which they have been trained. There is no guarantee that your specific use case is covered with enough qualitative data.Does this mean that LLMs cannot help with candidate screening? Not really. In practical terms, LLMs can assist in screening by automating the identification of relevant qualifications and experiences in CVs that can be used as input further along the screening cycle. They can also be used as natural language interfaces during initial communication with the candidate to verify specific requirements. In recruiting, LLMs should augment people’s work, not fully substitute it. They should not be relied upon to make final hiring decisions without human oversight. #ai #llms #screening #recruiting #chatgpt #claude",Using LLMs for CV screening requires caution and human oversight to avoid potential legal and bias issues.,0,['1'],,,,,

15,"I couldn't agree more!  When we start working together toward a common goal we can accomplish so much more!!!Paolo CasulaA university professor posed a challenge to his students. Each of them had a balloon with their name. The balloons would fall from the ceiling and they would have 5 minutes to find theirs. If everyone found the one with their name, they won... if not, they lost. Although they tried with all their energy to find them, no one succeeded. The teacher put the balloons back and told them, ""When you catch a balloon, give it to its owner"". The test took less than 3 minutes to complete. The teacher finished by saying, ""Happiness is like these balloons. If each of us looks only for our own, we will never find it. But if we look for others', we will also find ours.""

While most organizations keep going through the same old rote training on cybersecurity, data protection, etc. it's really time we got back to the basics and taught others the patterns to be aware of.... Below are my Top 5 things to be aware of:https://lnkd.in/eqeUwg8z1. Sensational Headlines - The promise of something too good to be true is as old as civilization.2. Urgency and Fear-mongering - Pressure to act quickly in a way that is outside of the norms should be setting off alarm bells in your head.3. Emotional Appeals - Another ancient tactic. No, your granddaughter didn't lose her passport and doesn't need money to return home. *If it sounds strange, consult others you trust!*4. Request for Personal Info or Money - This is the ultimate goal. If you feel unsure, tell the person you will get back to them. If the pressure skyrockets, rest assured you are being swindled!5. Inconsistency - It used to be typos and grammar would be a tell-tale sign. Things have progressed rapidly. Now you have to look for video and audio that don't line up together, strange cadence in speaking, inability to answer direct questions, etc.#ai #phishing #deepfakes #scammers #infosec #cybersecurityCEO of world’s biggest ad firm targeted by deepfake scam",Great insights on the patterns to be aware of in the age of AI tools and phishing attacks!,3,['3'],,,,,

It’s the spirit that either propels your company forward or holds it back.So, when the resume screams yes but the attitude doesn’t, think twice.Companies, it's time to look beyond just someone’s skill set.Let's focus on nurturing a culture of enthusiastic learners, not just experienced know-it-alls.The payoff?

With this massive product update, you can now reduce the post-purchase upsell and editing period as we get closer to your delivery cut offs. No more standardised grace periods. Don't make a single change to your current process.

Connect with your potential buyer The key here is you need to know your ICP.  • Buyer persona • Seniority level • Industry Then once you have found them send a blank connection request (this is a higher acceptance rate than personalization) because you can only send voices to 1st degree connected people. 2. Voice NoteNow its time to rip a voice note over to our prospect. This is where it gets fun. Follow my 10-30-10 framework.  First 10 seconds - the reason for the voice note.Why are you reaching out to them in the 1st place?• Job Changes• LinkedIn post• Triggers on their websiteNext 30 seconds - your value prop.What are you offering them that will help them in their SPECIFIC scenario or THAT SOLVES a pain point for them?Example: Our coaching services empower your sales rep to leverage our LinkedIn voice notes and video frameworks to book more meetings.Last 10 seconds - CALL TO ACTION.You need to tell people exactly what you want from them.I like Interest CTAs like:• Would you be interested in learning more?• Would you say this aligns with your top initiatives?• Are you curious to have a deeper dialogue on this topic?These frictionless CTAs typically open the prospect to respond and lead to more meetings.3. Follow UpThis is where I messed up the most when I started this. If no one responded I thought it was game over. 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘆. Wait 2-3 days after you send the voice note and follow up with this simple note. ""Any feedback on my voice message?""People love to give feedback so thats why this works to get a response. When you are out of the box, you get out of the box results. Mention someone that could benefit from this strategy. P.S.

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that processes images in a single pass, making it incredibly fast and efficient. By utilizing YOLO, I've developed a system that can accurately detect and track moving objects in video streams in real-time.💡 Why is this important? Moving object detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and traffic monitoring. By reliably identifying and tracking moving objects, we can enhance safety, security, and efficiency in numerous domains.🛠️ How does it work? My system leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect objects within a video frame. YOLO divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. By combining these predictions, I've created a robust moving object detection pipeline that can handle diverse environments and scenarios.🌐 Future applications: Moving object detection has immense potential for enhancing safety and security in smart cities, improving traffic management systems, and enabling advanced robotics. I'm excited to explore further applications and continue refining this technology.🔗 Interested in learning more or collaborating? Feel free to reach out!

This is like when data is organized in a database, making it easy to find things. But sometimes, it's not very convenient. You might need to go to different sections of the store to get everything on your shopping list.Now, imagine the store starts selling meal kits. These kits have everything you need for a specific recipe all bundled together. It's like having redundant data because some items might appear in more than one kit. But it saves you time and effort because you can grab everything you need for a meal in one go.Normalization is a design principle that helps eliminate redundant data and ensure data integrity. However, there are times when denormalization, the intentional introduction of redundant data, can be a powerful technique to optimize database performance. Denormalization is particularly useful in scenarios where read performance is critical, such as:➡️ Reporting and Analytics: Denormalized data structures can significantly improve the performance of complex analytical queries by reducing the need for joins and aggregations.➡️ Content Management Systems: Storing denormalized content data can enhance the speed of content retrieval and rendering, improving the user experience.➡️ Real-time Applications: Applications that require low-latency data access, such as stock trading platforms or gaming systems, can benefit from denormalized data structures.",Denormalization can be a powerful technique to optimize database performance in certain scenarios.,0,['1'],45.0,37.0,,,

104,"Last week, Anthropic Product VP Michael Gerstenhaber took the stage at MongoDB.Local in NYC with Dev Ittycheria for the keynote. 3 major takeaways on how enterprises are adopting AI today 👇1️⃣ AI Applications around Internal Tooling to accelerate key operational processes are dominant use cases today.For example, a major airline is using AI to allow gate agents, maintenance, and office staff to collaborate and find SMEs. Another use case is AI in law firms, capable of accelerating tasks like legal research. Pfizer uses Anthropic Claude to compare individuals' lab results with their vast oncology research base and accelerate the target assessment process from months to days, already seeing improved results 🚀2️⃣ Building an AI application is far more than model selection, it requires organization-wide collaboration.This usually means connecting engineers writing the application code and prompts with internal domain experts across the business first. It always means good prompting strategies and retrieval of proprietary, domain-specific data. He discussed common patterns in model orchestration; prompting (k-shot, tool use, chain of thought); fine-tuned models; storage, caching, and retrieval; and infrastructure options 🛠️3️⃣ Ecosystem programs like MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP) will be a key enabler for enterprise AI Adoption.AI is so new that organizational excitement is at an all-time high. Determining the use cases, strategies, and implementation with professional services will be critical as organizations tackle major operational challenges that require partners in a fast-changing environment ⚡",Great insights on enterprise AI adoption and the importance of organization-wide collaboration!,0,['2'],51.0,43.0,,,
105,"Hi All!On November 3rd, 2024, I will be running the New York City Marathon in support of an incredible organization called +POOL. +POOL follows in the footsteps of innovative public-private projects like The High Line and Hudson River Park’s Little Island. Its main focus is 1) to make swimming in NYC’s waters possible; 2) to build a first-of-its-kind river swim facility; and 3) to offer free swimming lessons to children who otherwise would not have the opportunity to learn. I believe one of the most important experiences a child can have in life is exposure to sport in an environment that is safe and accessible. That exposure can create, among other things, a sense of confidence and self-belief, a strong work ethic and desire to succeed, an understanding of how to work with others, and the simple but unforgettable feeling of pure joy. I've been fortunate to build a wonderful life around sports, and now want very much to play a small part in helping others do the same. If you would like to join me in this effort, please consider donating to +POOL using the link below. Your support would mean the world to me, to +POOL, and to children you may never meet, but whose lives you would undoubtedly be changing for the better.

When I spoke to some sixth formers at an academy in Greater London recently about this, as well as the solutions that Jonathan Haidt poses in his book ‘The Anxious Generation’ & the proposal being considered by UK ministers to ban smartphones, they were far more erudite and practical than many ‘experts’ I’ve listened to. Here are some of their reflections:1. ‘It would be a bit weird having no access to smartphones until you’re 16, then all of a sudden get given it in Year 11….some kids in September, and some in June -how does that work?’ ….Ummm, no idea!2. ‘Could there not be some sort of continuum, so like when you are 12 – you get a phone to text and call and have UberEats on it (!), then when you’re 14, you get Instagram and more stuff like that, and then when you’re 16 – you get what I’m saying?’…Yes, imminently sensible!3. ‘I think the alternatives need to be more compelling – then it’s not so negative. There doesn’t seem to be much of a focus on that, it’s just what you can’t/shouldn’t do’ …Absolutely, this more balanced approach would be more positive, effective and less conflict-generating. 4. ‘If they do this ban thing, what about google searching – are they going to ban that too, cause you can find loads of stuff on there that isn’t great too?’….Hmmm - not sure where they are going to slot that in!5. ‘Social media can bring up insecurities and speed up insecurities, but this is WAY worse when you are young – like in Year 7-10’…Educators, get these brilliant older students into primary schools to speak to parents and children6. ‘My willpower is rubbish, I just can’t resist looking at TikTok when I’m trying to do some work that’s hard or boring’…dismiss the concept of willpower as a way of regulating social media use, highlight that this is like trying to herd cats & focus on forming healthy digital habits instead (Pete Etchells - excellent voice on this)7. ‘Won’t the tech companies fight it? Will it be passed in time for when my little sister comes here?’….Tech companies will pose anything that threatens their profits. I don't know how long such legislation would take, but is there a chance your little sister would be in university before a smartphone ban for U16's came into force? Yes probably.I look forward to speaking to more students in the coming weeks to be further enlightened & draw together some simple principles to help guide discussions in schools & in families, to help children who are teenagers today, to thrive tomorrow.#teenagersnow #digitalagency Bettina Hohnen",Empowering teenagers to navigate social media challenges is crucial for their well-being and development.,3,['1'],96.0,88.0,,,

I first want to preface this long message with how grateful I am for where I am right now, and where I'm going next!I started my master's degree in Accounting this January continuing my education at the University of Colorado Boulder - Leeds School of Business. I am super grateful to continue to learn and thankful for all of the help I have received from my professors and mentors! I interned with RubinBrown LLP this winter as an assurance intern. I would like to thank Chris Daues for this opportunity by allowing me to continue learning in the professional world and see other possible paths in public accounting. Being able to intern during a busy season was very insightful in learning more about public accounting. I was also able to jump back onto the tax side and dip my toe into a little busy season with tax. Finally, I have concluded my time as Vice President with Beta Alpha Psi - Chapter Nu. I have been so grateful for everyone who I have met and worked with along the way the last three years. This organization is such a great way for students to get a foot in the door with professionals and help figure out what they might want to do after college.

154,"Last week, during the MDes program showcase, my teammates and I presented our product Poko to everyone. It evolved from our previous project, Nitri-Traker, with the aim of helping users detect excessive nitrite levels in pickled foods and nudging them towards healthier eating habits. Through iterative design, we optimized the user experience to better fit user needs. We modularized our product to differentiate between dry and wet modules, making it more portable. We also improved the user flow to simplify and secure the testing process. Additionally, we chose more environmentally friendly and recyclable materials for our test paper, allowing users to discard the portion with chemical liquids while recycling the rest, thus reducing material waste. Our design not only addresses food safety, public health, and environmental quality but also ensures the quality of industrial products. In essence, Poko is not just a measuring tool; it's a testament to the human-centered approach to design and the collaborative spirit that drives innovation and positive change.During this group collaboration, I gained a lot. We worked together happily, with passion and occasional anxiety. I'm grateful to have worked with Jiayi Liu, Weilong Gao, and Xingchen Cao. Jiayi's drive and tracking propelled the project forward, Weilong supported the hardware aspect, and Xingchen contributed to user experience design. Throughout the design process, we continuously reflected and organized our logic, always keeping user needs in mind. During the showcase, we confidently and smoothly presented Poko by posing questions, explaining issues, and integrating the demo into user scenarios, ensuring everyone understood the importance of Poko and our decision-making process during design. Special thanks to our instructors; without their guidance, we couldn't have brought this idea to fruition. Brian Hinch provided invaluable direction for our design, Sarah Stillpass Rosenbach offered crucial resource support for our user research, and Pierluigi Dalla Rosa was instrumental with his technical expertise.I appreciate Kyle Steinfeld's hosting for our team during the showcase. Thanks to all the guests, including Mike Kuniavsky, Abigayle Cosinuke, Nick Foster RDI , Savannah Johnson, Fatemeh Khatibloo (she/her), Rachel Maloney and Michelle Sindha Thomas for their feedback. Their presence injected new vitality into our design, and their suggestions and comments will support us in better thinking and designing.

Flexibility over uniformityTraditional 9-to-5 workdays aren't the only option.Work and life can be integrated in multiple flexible patterns, fitting different personal and professional needs.4. Personalized schedulesSome people might start their day with work, then take a long break, and work again in the evening.Others might work in a solid block and enjoy their personal time before and after.It all depends on individual lifestyle preferences and job requirements.3. Work and life are not opponentsThe concept of work-life balance often portrays work and personal life as competing forces.Instead, integrating them in a way that complements each other can lead to more satisfaction and productivity.Say, my work is a part of my life, not my whole life.2. Adapting to life’s needsDifferent life stages and personal commitments can shape one’s work-life structure.For instance, when you’re healthy, you can put in longer hours of work. But if you’re recovering from an illness you need to rest it out.This flexibility allows people to maximize their efficiency and enjoy meaningful personal time.1.

9,"AI startup founders: Is your product a ‘must have’ or just a ‘nice to have’?This is an important question to ask yourself as early as possible.Especially with the AI trend behind your back, it’s easy to confuse short-term interest with organic growth. 📈Companies with “GPT-Wrapper” type products (ChatGPT with UI rebranded for various use cases) are the most susceptible to this issue. With low entry barriers, competitors can easily replicate your offering, leaving you with a weak moat.↳ So, how can you strengthen your position in the AI startup landscape?The key lies in solving a complex and industry-specific problem with a highly fundamental approach instead of a broad, superficial solution.This may mean building a unique piece of technology, that isn’t just a reframing of existing AI models.To achieve this, you must leverage: •   AI trained on highly relevant, vetted data (RAG) •   Custom coded foundational models tailored to unique components and dynamics of the industry. •   A product that is significantly more cost effective and sustainable than relying on GPT tokens, and other paid APIs.Tackling one problem well with a unique model that cannot be easily replicated, will be your ticket to Series B and beyond, to a successful IPO. 🚀#AIStartup #FoundationalModels #GPTWrapper #ChatGPT #Product #SeriesB #API #FoundationalModel #IPO",Focus on building a unique foundational model to strengthen your position in the AI startup landscape.,0,['1'],,,,,,

We believe this future requires fundamentally new, efficient architectures for intelligence.Sonic is built on a new state space model architecture we’ve developed for efficiently modeling high resolution signals like audio and video. On speech, a parameter-matched and optimized Cartesia Sonic model trained on the same data as a widely used Transformer architecture improves audio quality (20% lower perplexity, 2x lower Word Error Rate, 1 point higher on the NISQA evaluation). At inference, it achieves lower latency (1.5x lower time-to-first-audio), faster inference speed (2x lower real-time factor), and higher throughput (4x).The playground features a diverse voice library for applications across customer support, entertainment, and content creation with support for instant cloning and voice design (speed, emotion), all of which can be used through the API.Read more in our release blog: https://lnkd.in/gcGxQd-BCheck us out on Product Hunt: https://lnkd.in/gA9h64yRTry Sonic: https://play.cartesia.aiWe're hiring across all roles!

16,"Thirteen years ago, when my daughter was in Kindergarten, I had the idea to buy the Dr. Seuss book, “Oh, the Place You Will Go” and have each of my daughter’s teachers sign the book at the end of every year until she graduates. Fast forward to today, my daughter is now set to graduate from High School this Friday. I had this idea, but it was my wife who executed it. Not only did she never miss a year, but she also did not miss a single teacher. I honestly felt a little embarrassed when my daughter was thanking us for such a thoughtful gift that required years of dogged determination. I got teary eyed when I saw her sitting on the back deck, reading the messages and smiling.I am telling this story because I am now going through the humbling process of interviewing for new commercial leadership roles. All the open job descriptions and interviews I have been on discuss wanting candidates with “strategic thinking”, but what about execution? How many of us have been in all day “strategy sessions"" with a whiteboard full of ideas only to see little results 6-12 months later because no one actually executed any of those great ideas. As Thomas Edison said, “Strategy without execution is hallucination.”Just as my wife executed this thirteen-year plan with the tenacity of a laser-focused mamma bear, I have had the pleasure of working with some great sales teams that took ideas and visions and made them into true success stories. I might have developed a game plan, but I had truly great players on the field bringing home the win.I just want to give a huge shout out to my wife, and my former teams, who took ideas and turned them into successes.This brought tears to my eyes. You are one of the best in the biz and I am so thankful I had the opportunity to strategize and execute with you. You have always energized me and my creative process and had the rigor to see the execution through with thoughtful accountability. I cannot wait to see where you go next... and I am thrilled to hear you will have a BUCKEYE in the family! ;) ","Your dedication to execution is truly admirable, and your wife's commitment to seeing a 13-year plan through is inspiring.

23,"Last week, I graduated from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communication at Syracuse University with a degree in Broadcast and Digital Journalism. After four years at Newhouse, I can say that most of my time was devoted to various clubs and internships.At CitrusTV, I spent three years serving as the Executive Producer of Talking Points (a national politics show). I also gained experience in producing News Live at Six (a local news show) and special programming, including the annual election night show. My responsibilities included writing scripts, copy-editing, and stacking rundowns (deciding stories, segments, elements, and time), managing a staff of producers, talent, and operations, and producing the live shows in a control room. I won several awards as recognition from the New York State Broadcasters Association for these shows. I was also an anchor for News Live at Six and Talking Points during my senior year.I also gained valuable television reporting experience. In January, I traveled to New Hampshire to cover the 2024 presidential primaries as a political multimedia journalist for Nexstar Media Group. I participated in a morning pitch meeting and was expected to file a package and digital article by the end of the day. Some days, I covered multiple candidates. On other days, I focused more on enterprise stories. I was responsible for shooting and editing the packages and writing the articles and scripts by a deadline. I interned at CNN in its New York Bureau during the Summer of 2022. I bylined ten different articles from original pitches and news-gathered each story from scratch, whether by making phone calls, filing document requests, or navigating social media to find information. I also helped with on-the-ground coverage at multiple news events and gained field-producing experience. I interned at MSNBC with “Alex Witt Reports” during the Summer of 2023. As a production intern, I contributed to segments by finding soundbites and critical information, such as data or polling numbers. I also pitched stories and segment ideas. I participated in script-writing feedback sessions with Alex Witt and her producers and gained insightful knowledge on how to write for network television. I also worked at DnG Media in the U.K., News Not Noise, WAER 88.3 FM, and International Policy Digest. I cannot thank these organizations enough for giving me valuable journalism experience during my collegiate years. Journalism has been a passion of mine since I was ten years old. I take great pride in waking up every morning and presenting the news to an audience. I am excited for the next chapter of my professional career and can't wait to share what's next for me as I continue pursuing my passion for reporting the news.","Congratulations on your graduation and impressive journalism experience, your dedication and hard work are truly inspiring!",3,['2'],,,,,,

Impossible.No matter where they worked. No matter where they went to school.No matter how polished their LinkedIn profile looks.The data on a resume or LinkedIn profile has no correlation to how good of a salesperson someone is. So instead, companies are stuck with bloated in-house GTM sourcing teams or overpaying for expensive recruiting agencies that don't have the ear or attention of top salespeople anyway. You're not going to hire a rockstar VP Sales or Ent AE by firing off messages via InMails. Or paying a recruiting agency to do it for you. Sorry, if it were just that easy... then your sales team would already be filled with rockstar talent. But it's not, is it? That's why we built Bravado AI, a recruiting product unlike any you've ever seen.

113,"This program is a good fit for you. As your proud COM 117 professor a few years back, what's more important to me is seeing how your writing and work ethic improve. We are fortunate to have you here at S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. I look forward to seeing you in the fall! #ProudProfRenée K.This semester, I enrolled in Good Molecules University, a semester-long student ambassador program for Beautylish Initially I thought the best part would be scoring some free products. But since its conclusion, I can say that I clearly underestimated what I was going to take away from this program. Not only were the free products an additional perk, but overall it was the workshops, projects, and on-campus activities I did throughout the semester that provided me with invaluable knowledge and skills that I can take with me throughout the rest of my time in college, and into the workforce after graduation. Our first project, the “Cities Project” allowed me the opportunity to learn presentation basics: from how to craft a simple yet compelling slide presentation, to working with a team to research, create, and present our project to not only the lead of the program, Kristen Kinley  but the CEO Nils Johnson as well. Not only did Brynn Burke , @nylamonastero, and I receive insightful feedback from Kristen and Nils, we were awarded 4th place for our work out of the student teams nationally! This recognition of our hard work not only showed me that our presentation was actually being watched, but that the program leads actually cared about our success in the project, and were willing to acknowledge and reward our hard work. Not only were Kristen and Nils actively attending the weekly workshops with us, they additionally set aside time every week for one-on-ones with the students, to share their experience in the corporate world, and answer questions we had about college, work, and everything in between. Their commitment to communicating with all the ambassadors really impressed me, and made me even more confident about my participation in this program. In addition to various other workshops throughout the semester, one that helped me the most was the time we spent learning Microsoft Excel. After 4 weeks learning important features in Microsoft Excel, I passed the associate certification exam with an excellent score of 962/1000. This would not have been possible without the lessons available through GMU. Finally, the in-person, on-campus activities I completed during the semester allowed me to practice pitching the benefits of the ambassador program, as well as individual products I was handing out. Additionally, the opportunity to get together with the other campus ambassador, Chaeri Chun, allowed me to engage with a wider public audience, and make a new friend. As I have now graduated from Good Molecules university with nothing but good things to say, I want to encourage other undergraduate students (from any school) to consider applying and taking advantage of this program. If you are interested, please reach out and I can send you the link to the application, and answer any questions you may have!",Congratulations on your success in the Good Molecules University program!,1,['2'],,,,,,
114,"When I tell folks I'm from Saudi Arabia, they assume I went to boarding school or had some other form of International education. I owe the lack of a distinctive accent to my American mom, but every other aspect of my education was in Arabic.When I moved to the U.S. 15 years ago to attend Case Western Reserve University, I frequently referenced my high school notebooks. I knew all the symbols, but many of the scientific and mathematical terms were foreign. This is my graduation picture at age 17, in formal attire. I came to the US on a scholarship, fully expecting to return back home.

126,"Embracing Failure: A Key to Success in SalesIn the world of sales, learning from failures is more valuable than winning every time. Diversity in experiences drives us to succeed, making each victory sweeter. I take pride in rebounding after a loss, a trait many sales managers have undervalued over the years.Too often, sales managers focus on ""What have you done for me lately?"" instead of ""How can we be better?"" This mindset has turned pipeline management into a toxic practice among many so-called sales leaders.I've been part of several new enterprise sales teams tasked with transforming growing companies from SMB to the Fortune 2000. Sales leaders are often hired for their past successes and are expected to exceed previous performance levels, leading to poor pipeline management.Many sales managers feel pressured to embellish their pipeline due to executive demands. Pride and ego can push even good managers to fudge numbers, hoping the team will save the day. While sometimes this works, when it doesn’t, jobs are lost. I’ve seen my forecast changed multiple times by managers, forcing me to live a life of stress, pushing deals prematurely to save my neck.The surge in fractional sales teams is partly driven by poor pipeline management. I've witnessed companies close due to this mismanagement and saw a company president replaced after two years because expectations for growth were unrealistically high. Achieving 30% YoY growth on $700M revenue with average deal sizes under $50K, while losing 5-10% in renewals, is a herculean task.Expectations need to be reviewed quarterly by the executive team, not yearly. Markets and demands change, and unforeseen factors arise. Fractional sales teams offer the flexibility to tailor strategies to current needs and adjust quickly.Key Takeaways:* Learn from Failures: Embrace setbacks as opportunities for growth.* Shift the Focus: Prioritize improvement over immediate results.* Realistic Expectations: Regularly review and adjust goals to reflect current market conditions.* Fractional Sales Teams: Leverage their flexibility for better adaptability and management.* Embrace the journey, learn from every setback, and adjust your sails to navigate the ever-changing seas of sales. 🌊💼 #SalesStrategy #Leadership #PipelineManagement",Embrace setbacks as opportunities for growth in sales.,0,['1'],,,,,,

Customers routinely told us our sales demos were 2nd to none. Here's 9 lessons I learned about SaaS sales demos I'll never forget:1. Show the most powerful feature FIRST.Most SaaS sellers don't do this. They 'build up' in a 'ramp up' demo.Wrong.Flip it upside down and show the top feature upfront.Let your buyer's head spin (in a good way).Unpack from there.2. Solve exactly.Want an easy way to speed customer decision making?Solve their pain on a 1:1 basis.No more, no less.Don't complicate it by showing all you've got.""We can also..."" leads to overwhelmed buyers.3. Catalyze a decision.What's the point of a demo?To inform? Educate?Neither. It's to catalyze a decision.What's the 'next' decision your buyer needs to make?Agree on that before the demo.Then, demo in the context of helping them make that decision:""My goal is to get you so FIRED up about what we do that at the end, you're willing to sponsor a meeting with your CMO, or you tell me I missed the mark. Fair?""Catalyze. Don't inform.4. Frame the problem.Summarize the buyer's challenge and impact before the demo.Then validate it:""Based on what you told me, you're going to LOVE this.""Let your buyer know they're in the right place.5. Orient them to the screen.Most buyers 3 minutes into SaaS demos:""WTF am I looking at?""Before you click around, explain what they're seeing.The confused mind says 'no.'6. Spend 10s framing the pain a feature solves before showing it.Remember how I said to frame the problem before the demo?Do a mini version of that for each feature you show.What's the pain it solves?Spend 10s summarizing that.THEN the feature will land with ease:""Earlier you said xyz is a headache. Here's how we solve that.""7. Tell a customer story after every key feature.Want your buyer to think about your demo for days?Tell a customer story after each click path.""Here's how X customer is using that workflow to solve Y pain""People remember stories and forget click paths.8. Ask a question after every key feature.Stop and have a conversation.Here are a few questions to test:- How does that compare to how you solve this today?- To what degree is this resonating so far?- To what extent do you see that solving x pain?- What benefits do you see showing up in your world from that?9. End your demo with ""What excited you most about what you saw today?""Transition to discussing next steps.Hope these help.P.S. I've watched over 3,000 Gong calls in my career.

141,"On February 22nd, I was rushed to The George Washington University Hospital due to the occurrence of multiple, sporadic seizures during my sleep. I was immediately placed under an IV, and observed by multiple neurologists and epilepsy specialists. With no personal nor family history of seizures, the doctors were bewildered, classifying me as a “genetic anomaly.” After regaining consciousness and undergoing copious amounts of testing such as multiple Spinal Taps, EEG’s MRI’s, and CT scans, I was discharged under the assumption of having viral meningitis, and was advised to return home and rest. Tired and exhausted from all the testing, I decided to take a nap at my Dad’s hotel prior to my flight back home. Upon opening my eyes, I found myself back in the ER, surrounded by another set of neurologists. Confused and unsure of what had happened, I scanned the room and soon realized that I had experienced another round of seizures. Through another week of intense testing, I was diagnosed with inconclusive epilepsy and short-term amnesia, creating a memory loss period spanning from August to February. To combat this unfortunate diagnosis, I was prescribed an anti-seizure medication for the foreseeable future.While many things felt uncertain and weary during this unfortunate experience, the presence of my community never wavered. From text messages to in-person visits, my community was stronger than ever, propelling me with the resources to get back on my feet and succeed. A prominent example of this has to do with my amnesia. With this unfortunate side effect, I was unable to recall a lot of memories. Whether it be names of people, locations, or what I had learned in my classes, it felt as though I was restarting the second semester of my Sophomore year. Through talking to multiple academic advisors, my professors, and some other connections, I was advised to take a gap semester and continue my studies in the Fall, but this was not the path I desired. Through a blend of hard work, determination, and help from my community, I persevered and finished the semester strong. As I wrap up my 2nd year at The George Washington University, this experience has illuminated the importance of community and self-care to me. If there's a final thought I can leave you with, it's this: strive for excellence in every facet of your life, but not at the expense of your health and well-being. Remember, your community is a valuable resource; lean into it whenever you need support, and most importantly, savor every moment that life offers.","I'm glad to hear that you had such a strong support system during this challenging time, and I admire your perseverance and determination to finish the semester strong.",3,['1'],,,,,,

165,"As a Cloud Architect, optimizing cloud consumption is a key objective. One challenge with Kubernetes is increasing worker node utilization, which isn't easy to do with kubectl. But with Prometheus and Grafana, we can collect and visualize kube state metrics and node metrics to identify workloads that can be optimized. Recently, we had some workloads with high memory utilization, causing HPA to auto scale the pods to twice the number of replicas and nodes. By allocating additional memory to the pod from idle capacity in the worker node, we were able to increase utilization, reduce the number of worker nodes and cut costs by ~50%. If you're looking for a great starting point to improve your observability, check out Grafana Labs  community dashboards. https://lnkd.in/eyDFeJSG#CloudOptimization #Kubernetes #Prometheus #Grafana #CloudArchitect #Observability #PlatformEngineering #DevOps #CloudNative #CNCF #OpenSource #FinOps",Great insights on optimizing cloud consumption and increasing worker node utilization with Prometheus and Grafana!,2,['2'],,,,,,

175,"Demo Day S24 was an incredible success. Garnering over 300 attendees in person and online, this was our largest event to date. Those in attendance witnessed the wildly impressive and surprisingly inspiring pitches by our innovative entrepreneurs.The night began with an uplifting and profound address by CEO, Andrew Bulgarino (MSB ‘25), before Grace McManus (CAS ‘26) took the stage as Master of Ceremonies. McManus delivered an eloquent and acutely witty performance to guide us throughout the night. Moving into our LaunchPad pitches, Vesta, Mesmo, Reservoir, Granulens, and Pavilion showed great promise, as they proudly displayed their pivotal work from the semester. From streamlining access to foods from home to predicting key impact investments, these entrepreneurs perfectly encapsulated the meaning of running a startup with their passion and impressive progress.Next, we moved into a conversation with inspiring entrepreneur, Eric Ji Sun Wu (SFS ‘17), founder of Gainful and Sobo Foods featured in Forbes 30 Under 30. No number of accolades or success stories could eclipse the wisdom he bestowed upon our student entrepreneurs and community. The conversation, brilliantly moderated by Margot Barrett, captured themes of persistence, drive, and endless curiosity. One theme remained constant throughout Eric’s words: you don’t need to be an engineer, a designer, a developer, or any other form of professional to make greatness happen. All you need to do is start.Then, our Venture Accelerator pitches truly blew us away. The 2nd Bloom Angel Network, Shanda Studio, Candela, and OpenGrid Technologies reminded us all that business is a mere means of expressing one’s passions, of using one’s voice. Notably, Shanda Studio, a second time GV cohort member, launched their platform last night at our event. Additionally, Andrea Poma gave a beautifully emotional pitch that conveyed passion for bringing the world her innovative and artisanal products. This brilliant pitch, embellished with crisp, editorial product shots and even an in-person model, won Poma and Candela the people’s choice prize of $500.We are endlessly proud of the cohort and community we cultivated this semester. While Demo Day marks the end of their time in the S24 cohort, we will continue to support our startups and watch them grow for years to come. We are confident that this group will go on to change the world, and we advise you to remember their names for when they make it big.We offer a special thanks to Jeff Reid and Aveline Argo at Georgetown Entrepreneurship, as well as Jessica Bieligk and Ken Williams for their support as advisors.Finally, thank you to Andrew Bulgarino, Dylan Williams, Arlie Rubin, Joey Trigiani, Liam McKenna, Whitney Bartol, Lucy Olander, Sophie Molitor, Kendall Beil, Margot Barrett, Kristen Yee, and Monty Singer for your incredible leadership this semester.

Their insights expanded our substantive understanding of resilient health systems, while allowing us to strengthen our communication skills. 📅 Wednesday: We visited the Center for Strategic and International Studies for the Washington Humanitarian Forum, focusing on the climate-conflict nexus. Attending panels on sustainable climate financing, humanitarian action, and climate zones provided invaluable insights into the sociopolitical factors that shape climate and health. Making connections between climate, conflict, and nutrition emphasized the intricate web of challenges we must address collectively.

228,"I see many guides and examples of using ChatGPT and Claude for CV screening, from AI influencers, HR Tech professionals and startups building on top of LLMs. This is awful. Most guides go like this:- Copy the job description- Copy 3-5 parsed resumes- Write a detailed prompt asking GPT to compare the profiles to the job description.- Paste all these in GPT and save tons of time with the results.This is a bit concerning for a few reasons:- This is probably illegal in quite a few countries, because LLMs are black boxes and there is no explainability or interpretability as to how the screening results are generated- LLMs get worse with extended context, so pasting 10-20 pages of text decreases the quality of response and parts of your prompt will be cut off anyway with GPT3.5.- Bias – LLMs are trained on vast datasets that inevitably contain biases present in the source material – this has been shown multiple times in different studies, including recruiting cases.- Sharing candidate private data with GPT without their consentWith some advanced implementation, specific problems above can be fixed, like removing personal data or using advanced models to reduce context limitation size.However, the worst problem here is a fundamental lack of understanding of how LLMs work. The absence of real-world awareness or common sense reasoning in LLMs is a critical drawback in screening profiles.While LLMs can process and generate text based on patterns, they do not understand the text in the human sense. Their ""understanding"" is limited to statistical correlations between words and phrases in their training data. LLMs operate strictly within the scope of the text data on which they have been trained. There is no guarantee that your specific use case is covered with enough qualitative data.Does this mean that LLMs cannot help with candidate screening? Not really. In practical terms, LLMs can assist in screening by automating the identification of relevant qualifications and experiences in CVs that can be used as input further along the screening cycle. They can also be used as natural language interfaces during initial communication with the candidate to verify specific requirements. In recruiting, LLMs should augment people’s work, not fully substitute it. They should not be relied upon to make final hiring decisions without human oversight. #ai #llms #screening #recruiting #chatgpt #claude",Using LLMs for CV screening requires caution and human oversight to avoid potential legal and bias issues.,0,['1'],10.0,,,,,

The teacher put the balloons back and told them, ""When you catch a balloon, give it to its owner"". The test took less than 3 minutes to complete.

Connect with your potential buyer The key here is you need to know your ICP.  • Buyer persona • Seniority level • Industry Then once you have found them send a blank connection request (this is a higher acceptance rate than personalization) because you can only send voices to 1st degree connected people. 2. Voice NoteNow its time to rip a voice note over to our prospect. This is where it gets fun. Follow my 10-30-10 framework.  First 10 seconds - the reason for the voice note.Why are you reaching out to them in the 1st place?• Job Changes• LinkedIn post• Triggers on their websiteNext 30 seconds - your value prop.What are you offering them that will help them in their SPECIFIC scenario or THAT SOLVES a pain point for them?Example: Our coaching services empower your sales rep to leverage our LinkedIn voice notes and video frameworks to book more meetings.Last 10 seconds - CALL TO ACTION.You need to tell people exactly what you want from them.I like Interest CTAs like:• Would you be interested in learning more?• Would you say this aligns with your top initiatives?• Are you curious to have a deeper dialogue on this topic?These frictionless CTAs typically open the prospect to respond and lead to more meetings.3. Follow UpThis is where I messed up the most when I started this. If no one responded I thought it was game over. 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘆. Wait 2-3 days after you send the voice note and follow up with this simple note. ""Any feedback on my voice message?""People love to give feedback so thats why this works to get a response. When you are out of the box, you get out of the box results. Mention someone that could benefit from this strategy. P.S.

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that processes images in a single pass, making it incredibly fast and efficient. By utilizing YOLO, I've developed a system that can accurately detect and track moving objects in video streams in real-time.💡 Why is this important? Moving object detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and traffic monitoring. By reliably identifying and tracking moving objects, we can enhance safety, security, and efficiency in numerous domains.🛠️ How does it work? My system leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect objects within a video frame. YOLO divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. By combining these predictions, I've created a robust moving object detection pipeline that can handle diverse environments and scenarios.🌐 Future applications: Moving object detection has immense potential for enhancing safety and security in smart cities, improving traffic management systems, and enabling advanced robotics. I'm excited to explore further applications and continue refining this technology.🔗 Interested in learning more or collaborating? Feel free to reach out!

This is like when data is organized in a database, making it easy to find things. But sometimes, it's not very convenient. You might need to go to different sections of the store to get everything on your shopping list.Now, imagine the store starts selling meal kits. These kits have everything you need for a specific recipe all bundled together. It's like having redundant data because some items might appear in more than one kit. But it saves you time and effort because you can grab everything you need for a meal in one go.Normalization is a design principle that helps eliminate redundant data and ensure data integrity. However, there are times when denormalization, the intentional introduction of redundant data, can be a powerful technique to optimize database performance. Denormalization is particularly useful in scenarios where read performance is critical, such as:➡️ Reporting and Analytics: Denormalized data structures can significantly improve the performance of complex analytical queries by reducing the need for joins and aggregations.➡️ Content Management Systems: Storing denormalized content data can enhance the speed of content retrieval and rendering, improving the user experience.➡️ Real-time Applications: Applications that require low-latency data access, such as stock trading platforms or gaming systems, can benefit from denormalized data structures.",Denormalization can be a powerful technique to optimize database performance in certain scenarios.,0,['1'],98.0,45.0,37.0,,,

322,"Last week, Anthropic Product VP Michael Gerstenhaber took the stage at MongoDB.Local in NYC with Dev Ittycheria for the keynote. 3 major takeaways on how enterprises are adopting AI today 👇1️⃣ AI Applications around Internal Tooling to accelerate key operational processes are dominant use cases today.For example, a major airline is using AI to allow gate agents, maintenance, and office staff to collaborate and find SMEs. Another use case is AI in law firms, capable of accelerating tasks like legal research. Pfizer uses Anthropic Claude to compare individuals' lab results with their vast oncology research base and accelerate the target assessment process from months to days, already seeing improved results 🚀2️⃣ Building an AI application is far more than model selection, it requires organization-wide collaboration.This usually means connecting engineers writing the application code and prompts with internal domain experts across the business first. It always means good prompting strategies and retrieval of proprietary, domain-specific data. He discussed common patterns in model orchestration; prompting (k-shot, tool use, chain of thought); fine-tuned models; storage, caching, and retrieval; and infrastructure options 🛠️3️⃣ Ecosystem programs like MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP) will be a key enabler for enterprise AI Adoption.AI is so new that organizational excitement is at an all-time high. Determining the use cases, strategies, and implementation with professional services will be critical as organizations tackle major operational challenges that require partners in a fast-changing environment ⚡",Great insights on enterprise AI adoption and the importance of organization-wide collaboration!,0,['2'],104.0,51.0,43.0,,,
323,"Hi All!On November 3rd, 2024, I will be running the New York City Marathon in support of an incredible organization called +POOL. +POOL follows in the footsteps of innovative public-private projects like The High Line and Hudson River Park’s Little Island. Its main focus is 1) to make swimming in NYC’s waters possible; 2) to build a first-of-its-kind river swim facility; and 3) to offer free swimming lessons to children who otherwise would not have the opportunity to learn. I believe one of the most important experiences a child can have in life is exposure to sport in an environment that is safe and accessible. That exposure can create, among other things, a sense of confidence and self-belief, a strong work ethic and desire to succeed, an understanding of how to work with others, and the simple but unforgettable feeling of pure joy. I've been fortunate to build a wonderful life around sports, and now want very much to play a small part in helping others do the same. If you would like to join me in this effort, please consider donating to +POOL using the link below. Your support would mean the world to me, to +POOL, and to children you may never meet, but whose lives you would undoubtedly be changing for the better.

367,"Teenagers are underrated & we can underestimate the value they bring to solving, in words of LIS: The London Interdisciplinary School,  'complex problems', and how to empower young people to optimise the benefits and minimise the challenges of social media would certainly qualify as a ‘complex problem’.  Carrie James & Emily Weinstein are exceptional people to follow if you want to understand more about teens' perspectives on this issue. When I spoke to some sixth formers at an academy in Greater London recently about this, as well as the solutions that Jonathan Haidt poses in his book ‘The Anxious Generation’ & the proposal being considered by UK ministers to ban smartphones, they were far more erudite and practical than many ‘experts’ I’ve listened to. Here are some of their reflections:1. ‘It would be a bit weird having no access to smartphones until you’re 16, then all of a sudden get given it in Year 11….some kids in September, and some in June -how does that work?’ ….Ummm, no idea!2. ‘Could there not be some sort of continuum, so like when you are 12 – you get a phone to text and call and have UberEats on it (!), then when you’re 14, you get Instagram and more stuff like that, and then when you’re 16 – you get what I’m saying?’…Yes, imminently sensible!3. ‘I think the alternatives need to be more compelling – then it’s not so negative. There doesn’t seem to be much of a focus on that, it’s just what you can’t/shouldn’t do’ …Absolutely, this more balanced approach would be more positive, effective and less conflict-generating. 4. ‘If they do this ban thing, what about google searching – are they going to ban that too, cause you can find loads of stuff on there that isn’t great too?’….Hmmm - not sure where they are going to slot that in!5. ‘Social media can bring up insecurities and speed up insecurities, but this is WAY worse when you are young – like in Year 7-10’…Educators, get these brilliant older students into primary schools to speak to parents and children6. ‘My willpower is rubbish, I just can’t resist looking at TikTok when I’m trying to do some work that’s hard or boring’…dismiss the concept of willpower as a way of regulating social media use, highlight that this is like trying to herd cats & focus on forming healthy digital habits instead (Pete Etchells - excellent voice on this)7. ‘Won’t the tech companies fight it? Will it be passed in time for when my little sister comes here?’….Tech companies will pose anything that threatens their profits. I don't know how long such legislation would take, but is there a chance your little sister would be in university before a smartphone ban for U16's came into force? Yes probably.I look forward to speaking to more students in the coming weeks to be further enlightened & draw together some simple principles to help guide discussions in schools & in families, to help children who are teenagers today, to thrive tomorrow.#teenagersnow #digitalagency Bettina Hohnen",Empowering teenagers to navigate social media challenges is crucial for their well-being and development.,3,['1'],149.0,96.0,88.0,,,

372,"Last week, during the MDes program showcase, my teammates and I presented our product Poko to everyone. It evolved from our previous project, Nitri-Traker, with the aim of helping users detect excessive nitrite levels in pickled foods and nudging them towards healthier eating habits. Through iterative design, we optimized the user experience to better fit user needs. We modularized our product to differentiate between dry and wet modules, making it more portable. We also improved the user flow to simplify and secure the testing process. Additionally, we chose more environmentally friendly and recyclable materials for our test paper, allowing users to discard the portion with chemical liquids while recycling the rest, thus reducing material waste. Our design not only addresses food safety, public health, and environmental quality but also ensures the quality of industrial products. In essence, Poko is not just a measuring tool; it's a testament to the human-centered approach to design and the collaborative spirit that drives innovation and positive change.During this group collaboration, I gained a lot. We worked together happily, with passion and occasional anxiety. I'm grateful to have worked with Jiayi Liu, Weilong Gao, and Xingchen Cao. Jiayi's drive and tracking propelled the project forward, Weilong supported the hardware aspect, and Xingchen contributed to user experience design. Throughout the design process, we continuously reflected and organized our logic, always keeping user needs in mind. During the showcase, we confidently and smoothly presented Poko by posing questions, explaining issues, and integrating the demo into user scenarios, ensuring everyone understood the importance of Poko and our decision-making process during design. Special thanks to our instructors; without their guidance, we couldn't have brought this idea to fruition. Brian Hinch provided invaluable direction for our design, Sarah Stillpass Rosenbach offered crucial resource support for our user research, and Pierluigi Dalla Rosa was instrumental with his technical expertise.I appreciate Kyle Steinfeld's hosting for our team during the showcase. Thanks to all the guests, including Mike Kuniavsky, Abigayle Cosinuke, Nick Foster RDI , Savannah Johnson, Fatemeh Khatibloo (she/her), Rachel Maloney and Michelle Sindha Thomas for their feedback. Their presence injected new vitality into our design, and their suggestions and comments will support us in better thinking and designing.

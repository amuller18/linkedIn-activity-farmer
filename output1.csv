0,Bella Kosienski,"Wow... what an eventful semester! I first want to preface this long message with how grateful I am for where I am right now, and where I'm going next!I started my master's degree in Accounting this January continuing my education at the University of Colorado Boulder - Leeds School of Business. I am super grateful to continue to learn and thankful for all of the help I have received from my professors and mentors! I interned with RubinBrown LLP this winter as an assurance intern. I would like to thank Chris Daues for this opportunity by allowing me to continue learning in the professional world and see other possible paths in public accounting. Being able to intern during a busy season was very insightful in learning more about public accounting. I was also able to jump back onto the tax side and dip my toe into a little busy season with tax. Finally, I have concluded my time as Vice President with Beta Alpha Psi - Chapter Nu. I have been so grateful for everyone who I have met and worked with along the way the last three years. This organization is such a great way for students to get a foot in the door with professionals and help figure out what they might want to do after college. The board for the 24/25 year is going to do amazing and I'm excited to see it.I am excited to see what is to come next!",Announcement

Software Development, Banking & Finance, and even Media & Communications are feeling the pinch, with declines ranging from 29% to over 44%.🔥🔥🔥So, what’s happening here?👇Is this a natural evolution, or are there deeper forces at play?

It's the key for business growth.Unethical business practices? They don't define profit. Integrity does.Profit vs. ethical values? These are not opponents. If you are ethical you make more profitLet's flip the narrative:Profit, when pursued with integrity, is not just a number—it's a testament to a business's impact and success. It fuels reinvestment, innovation, job creation, and positive influence.Profit is essential for your business health and longevity.

23,Dominic Hudson,"When I first interviewed with Meta in 2021, I received an offer to join as a Machine Learning Engineer.  In a move that shocked my recruiter (“Everyone is trying to do the opposite!”), I asked to come in as a pure software engineer instead, essentially throwing away my ML interview. I was used to ML models being trained & deployed by two different people: Data Scientists owning the training and then handing them over to Software Engineers to turn them into a product. It was only after I joined when I realised that this is not how ML works at Meta: most ML work here is performed by the same person. They are responsible for training models and bringing them to production. This shortens the time between designing and deploying a model.  I ended up working closely with ML here anyway. You’re very much encouraged to do what it takes to achieve the business impact, regardless of formal role delineations.And so, in a full circle, I decided to formalise this and have now made the transition back to Machine Learning Engineer. It was a slightly odd journey, but I made it 😉I thought the process of data scientists training models- and throw it over the fence to MLE's to deploy and monitor them was always a strange concept. Yet I did that for years.I much prefer owning the full end-to-end of ML, and getting support from specialists when needed.",Lesson

28,Cal Al-Dhubaib,"Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) is one of my favorite conferences! The overwhelming theme? It's time for GenAI to get a bit more boring. Some of my favorite takeaways:1. Human led AI is THE path forward 🤝 Behind the scenes of most sophisticated AI deployments is an army of humans diligently labeling data and available to oversee and intervene when weird results inevitably happen.📋If humans aren't yet doing something, seriously question why you're excited to do it with AI. Even when it makes sense, think about how you would evaluate, orchestrate, and manage human-led work. 2. Build AI for Trust ⚖️ Beatrice Botti gave an incredible overview of the regulatory landscape. While individual regs may differ on the fringes, they share core requirements. Even though conformity assessments are required for high risk AI applications, this may be an opportunity to proactively build trust in how brands approach AI. 🛡️ But don't forget for all data collected there is finite purpose with a finite timeline. In many cases, we discover new use cases after data has been collected. Don't fall for the illusion of the value of data when it's a liability. 3. The future of large language models is small 💸 Micro costs add up - calling 100k pages a day via OpenAI is > $2m/yr. 📈 Kate Soule shared research results from IBM demonstrating small, tailored, models perform better on specialized tasks relative to larger general models, even if the larger model scores higher on benchmarks. 3. GenAI ops is maturing⚙️ Subtle changes to lange models may have significant impact on assets like prompts, making large scale investments vulnerable to model provider updates or failures. 🔧 As one of examples of this Amber R. showcased Arize AI's open source suite of tools to diagnose LLM-based solutions from prompts to retrieving context to results. Great to catch up with so many legends including Tamilla Triantoro, Anna Litvak-Hinenzon, PhD, Adam Ross Nelson, Keith McCormick, and Jon Krohn.

31,Dave Kranowitz,"When you finish a huge Q4 with an absolute bang (including two of our biggest deals/competitive takeouts in history), it's hard to imagine a Q1 that compares. Still, here we are again - setting a new record for our largest deal in history and also passing so many milestones - including 5K paying customers and our most successful user conference EVER. What makes the quarter we just finished yesterday even more remarkable is how we operated through a variety of internal changes but kept moving forward. Every geo found new rhythms and contributed and we had reps at every level of seniority jump on the leaderboard - from our most seasoned to those recently promoted from SDR roles and so much in between. Were there grueling moments? Of course. We slipped some deals, we said goodbye to people we cared about, we gave and received some feedback that was tough to hear. But we made it. A special thank you to our brothers and sisters across the org and those who stuck with it. My CEO slacked me from Singapore. All he said was, ""I am so happy."" We are on to Q2.",Announcement
32,Eddie Park,"PSA: Use simple designs if you are a new business or startup. 💡You may be eager to see that fancy logo & website you envisioned come to life, but building upon a simpler design language has many benefits especially for the early stages.A simple design language consists of: -      Basic shapes & forms -      Keeping color scheme to 3 colors max ( Excluding white / black ) -      Using universal fonts ( Helvetica, Inter, Proxima, etc )Its massive benefits are: -      Design, build and set up your landing page quickly -      Make changes and pivot easily ( important bc you will need to overhaul your landing page several times as you adjust your target user / customer ) -      Easily apply it in various contexts ( product UI / website / marketing content / presentation deck ), while maintaining consistency… and your one-person design team ( maybe it’s you ) will thank you immensely.“But Eddie, how can I build a unique and stand-out brand if I keep things THAT simple?” 🤷‍♂️I’ve seen plenty of companies rebrand their logos/ design identity to something more unique, after they find product/service market fit.Remember, Netflix was once ‘Kibble’ and Google was ‘Backrub’ for the first 6 months. ( No, seriously! just google it )So, keep that fully animated 3D website of your dreams for later, and move fast with a light and agile design language ⚡️⚡️P.S You can even speed up your design process further by leveraging publicly available icon sets from companies like Google or IBM – I’ll share more on that in a later post.#designlanguage #designsystem #ui #ux #website #startup #newbusiness #founder #fonts #component #agile #landingpage",Irrelevant

I was awarded this alongside my collaborator Helene Kertanis for the work we have pursued and completed with our bachelor of fine arts thesis, a short titled 'You Are Here.' Helene & I have been working on this project for the entirety of the past academic year. It is a female-centric story crafted by an entirely female & non-binary team for all facets of production. Participating in the BFA thesis program has been one of the most rewarding experiences, and I am so fortunate to be recognized by the Emerson filmmaking community. I would also like to share that I won the EVVY Award for Outstanding Production Design for Studio Television with the set I co-designed & built with Lulu Dalzell and Edith LeMoine for Closing Time with Simone Ochalek.

Thank you to everyone who voted for me and stopped by my booth. If you'd like to try out my project for yourself, use this link!:https://lnkd.in/gupjaxgxThe story behind my project: After an animated disagreement with my friend Mohamed Elaagip over who the GOAT of the UFC is, I set out to prove him wrong mathematically. I also love to play online chess. Upon realizing chess is a 1v1 sport with a algorithmic ranking system (ELO), I slightly tweaked that same algorithm and applied it to ranking UFC fighters. Thus, the UFC ELO Ranker was born. (My friend's GOAT pick ended up being wrong, thank god, otherwise I might've just deleted the project lol)If you're curious to see the rankings or the code, check out my github! Current Version (Python):https://lnkd.in/gfJYSKF3Original Version (Flutter): https://lnkd.in/gqYnYaAiI've also been diving head-first into machine learning, and saw this as a great opportunity to practice. I began predicting UFC fights using classification with logistical regression and neural networks, with a multitude of features. Feel free to check out the code on github!github:https://lnkd.in/gb3AphJpMy workflow:I apply important important DevOps principles such as creating short-lived feature branches, frequently merging into main, and organizing my thoughts / priorities with labeled issues that are linked with corresponding pull requests. There's examples in the pictures, but there are many more examples on my github!I also periodically go back through my code and refactor it to be more efficient, readable, and easily modifiable. For example, I refactored 60 lines of code into 6. Great engineers keep it simple if possible. Examples are linked in the media below.An overview of my development process:Initially, I tried to make this project with SpringBoot Java and MySQL. I made some progress, but incredibly slowly. I then switched to Flutter, intrigued by it's ability to compile code to IOS, Android, and the browser. I also swapped MySQL for a comedically large JSON file, as this approach was much simpler. I then worked on the project diligently for 3 months. There were MANY trials and errors, and I learned a ton through it all. After writing and re-writing many lines of code, I finally got the backend of the ranking system to work! However I struggled to create proper visualizations of my findings in flutter, so I chose to transition to Python, which has many data visualization tools. That's the story for now... more to come in the future!",Irrelevant

""나는 평범한 소년 이었다.이해력도 빠르지 않았다. 추상적인 사고를 따라가는 능력도 부족했다"" 그는 그리스, 라틴어, 수학도 못했다. 그가 유일하게 좋아한것은 자연관찰과 생물수집이었다고 한다.아버지는 그에게 ""너는 스스로의 명예도 먹칠하고 우리 가족에도 망신거리다""라고 했다. 아버지는 다윈이 비글호탐사를 가는데에도 반대했다.다윈은 겨우 허락을 득하여 5년간 비글호 탐사를 한다. 그는 우직하게 야생 동식물을 관찰하며 힘들고 단조로운 작업을 악착같이 해내었다.  따개비 조사 연구만 8년을 소요했다.4. 도쿠시마대학이라는 유명치 않은 대학을 나와 중소기업 직장인으로 일하며 연구하다가 LED로 노벨상을 수상한 나카무라 슈지도 이런말을 했다. ""10년 이상 아침부터 밤까지 용접을 했고 한달에 두세번은 폭발사고가 있었다. 실험에 실험을 거듭했다. 돌아가도 좋다. 서툴러도 좋다. 하나를 완성하는 일 그것이 중요하다. 아무리 최첨단 기술이라도 장인기술이라는 기술력이 필요하다. 한가지에 깊이 몰두해야 혁신이 일어난다. 우리 모두 아인슈타인은 될수 없지만 에디슨은 될수 있다고 생각한다.""6. 물론, 머리까지 뛰어나면 좋겠지만,  세상의 획을 긋는 성취는 대개 '머리'와 '효율'에서 나오는게  아니다. 특정분야에 대한 강렬한 소명의식, 강한 흥미, 인내와 끈기에서 나온다. 7. 당신은 어디에 소명과 흥미를 가지고 있는가?p.s.  링친들의 댓글은 다른 분들에게 도움을 줍니다.※이현세의 '천재를 이기는 법'--------살다 보면 꼭 한번은 재수가 좋든지 나쁘든지 천재를 만나게 된다. 대다수 우리들은 이 천재와 경쟁하다가 상처투성이가 되든지, 아니면 자신의 길을 포기하게 된다.그리고 평생 주눅 들어 살든지, 아니면 자신의 취미나 재능과는 상관없는 직업을 가지고 평생 못 가본 길에 대해서 동경하며 산다. 이처럼 자신의 분야에서 추월할 수 없는 천재를 만난다는 것은 끔찍하고 잔인한 일이다.어릴 때 동네에서 그림에 대한 신동이 되고, 학교에서 만화에 대한 재능을 인정받아 만화계에 입문해서 동료들을 만났을 때, 내 재능은 도토리 키 재기라는 것을 알았다.그 중에 한두 명의 천재를 만났다. 나는 불면증에 시달릴 정도로 매일매일 날밤을 새우다시피 그림을 그리며 살았다.내 작업실은 이층 다락방이었고 매일 두부장수 아저씨의 종소리가 들리면 남들이 잠자는 시간만큼 나는 더 살았다는 만족감으로 그제서야 쌓인 원고지를 안고 잠들곤 했다.그러나 그 친구는 한달 내내 술만 마시고 있다가도며칠 휘갈겨서 가져오는 원고로 내 원고를 휴지로 만들어 버렸다.나는 타고난 재능에 대해 원망도 해보고 이를 악물고 그 친구와 경쟁도 해 봤지만 시간이 갈수록 내 상처만 커져갔다. 만화에 대한 흥미가 없어지고 작가가 된다는 생각은 점점 멀어졌다.내게도 주눅이 들고 상처 입은 마음으로 현실과 타협해서 사회로 나가야 될 시간이 왔다. 그러나 나는 만화에 미쳐 있었다.새 학기가 열리면 이 천재들과 싸워서 이기는 방법을 학생들에게 꼭 강의한다. 그것은 천재들과 절대로 정면승부를 하지 말라는 것이다. 천재를 만나면 먼저 보내주는 것이 상책이다. 그러면 상처 입을 필요가 없다.작가의 길은 장거리 마라톤이지 단거리 승부가 아니다. 천재들은 항상 먼저 가기 마련이고, 먼저 가서 뒤돌아보면 세상살이가 시시한 법이고, 그리고 어느 날 신의 벽을 만나 버린다.인간이 절대로 넘을 수 없는 신의 벽을 만나면 천재는 좌절하고 방황하고 스스로를 파괴한다. 그리고 종내는 할 일을 잃고 멈춰서 버린다.이처럼 천재를 먼저 보내놓고 10년이든 20년이든 자신이 할 수 있다는 생각으로 하루하루를 꾸준히 걷다 보면 어느 날 멈춰버린 그 천재를 추월해서 지나가는 자신을 보게 된다. 산다는 것은 긴긴 세월에 걸쳐 하는 장거리 승부이지 절대로 단거리 승부가 아니다.만화를 지망하는 학생들은 그림을 잘 그리고 싶어한다. 그렇다면 매일매일 스케치북을 들고 10장의 크로키를 하면 된다. 1년이면 3500장을 그리게 되고 10년이면 3만 5000장의 포즈를 잡게 된다. 그 속에는 온갖 인간의 자세와 패션과 풍경이 있다.한마디로 이 세상에서 그려보지 않은 것은 거의 없는 것이다. 거기에다 좋은 글도 쓰고 싶다면, 매일매일 일기를 쓰고 메모를 하면 된다. 가장 정직하게 내면 세계를 파고 들어가는 설득력과 온갖 상상의 아이디어와 줄거리를 갖게 된다.자신만이 경험한 가장 진솔한 이야기는 모두에게 감동을 준다. 만화가 이두호 선생은 항상 “만화는 엉덩이로 그린다.”라고후배들에게 조언한다. 이 말은 언제나 내게 감동을 준다. 평생을 작가로서 생활하려면 지치지 않는 집중력과 지구력보다 더 중요한 것은 없다.가끔 지구력 있는 천재도 있다. 그런 천재는 존재하는 것만으로도 축복이고 보는 것만으로도 감사하다. 그런 천재들은 너무나 많은 즐거움과 혜택을 우리에게 주고 우리들의 갈 길을 제시해 준다. 나는 그런 천재들과 동시대를 산다는 것만 해도 가슴 벅차게 행복하다.나 같은 사람은 그저 잠들기 전에 한 장의 그림만 더 그리면 된다. 해 지기 전에 딱 한 걸음만 더 걷다보면 어느 날 내 자신이 바라던 모습과 만나게 될 것이다. 그것이 정상이든, 산중턱이든 내가 원하는 것은 내가 바라던 만큼만 있으면 되는 것이다.",News
94,Cal Al-Dhubaib,"Having a blast Open Data Science Conference (ODSC)! Just finished my talk ""Designing AI for Trust"" where I shared strategies to empower humans to create tremendous value with AI. Here were my key points:1. Cultivate an AI literate workforce - equip your teams to know when to trust AI and when to question it. This should be as effortless as driving a car. 2. Design for decisions - understand that humans can be silly and the real value of AI is measured in terms of actions and behavior change, not model accuracy and benchmarks. 3. Humans in and over the loop! Despite guardrails, there are many ways for models to be wrong - understand the costs and design workflows to augment decisions. Invest in human experts available to audit, oversee, and orchestrate as needed. Clearly communicate and summarize the above into model and data cards to reinforce trust over time. Thanks to everyone who attended! What measures have you used to build trust in AI?Photo creds Keith McCormick Kristy Hollingshead Amber R. 📸",Lesson

Not knowing this investor secret could cost you $1,000,000s in valuation.As a business owner or startup founder, you've dreamt of selling your business at substantial valuations. 💸While some stellar businesses achieve multiples of 8x or 10x their EBITDA, most small and medium businesses settle for 1.5x to 2x.So, what sets these businesses apart?➡️ Systemization.Investors avoid companies that are purely labor-intensive, where losing the people means losing the business.

102,Gianni Scarpino Candy,"The act of creating experiences that bring joy and delight to the world is my second favorite thing. Collaborating with others to elevate those creations is my first.  Last year I had the opportunity to co-create a visual identity to celebrate and welcome ABK to the team. We pulled inspiration from the Northern Lights and the limitless possibilities only an aurora filled sky can make us feel. We listened to stakeholders to ensure the final design felt welcoming, energizing, inclusive, and aligned to the Xbox brand. Together we made the aurora tangible. Today the impact of this viz id really hit me, as I opened this beautifully crafted box of swag. It’s the same box that thousands of other employees are also opening up, all across the world. It’s a physical object that still possesses that digital glow and big sky energy, now in print form.It’s so wild to see this IRL in my house right now. To me, it’s a really great reminder that I’m part of something bigger with a team way bigger and more far reaching than I often realize. I hope everyone who received this now feels a bit more connected, too. 💚 Thanks a million for the opportunity, big vision, thoughtful feedback, and endless encouragement Jessie Thomas and Kristine Golus.

106,Ashley Fu,"Today is my last day with the Food Network & HGTV brand research team at Warner Bros. Discovery  and I just wanted to share a little about my #wbdlife experience here.When I got the internship offer for the New York City office, I knew I faced a choice. As I was still finishing up my last semester at Georgetown, it meant that I needed to commute to New York every week and miss out on my senior spring. But I love consumer insights, I’ve always wanted to explore the entertainment industry, and I’m a big foodie. At that second, saying yes felt so easy.What I was able to learn and achieve in this internship has taught me that you should never ignore an open door. In the past 12 weeks, I worked on my favorite TV shows, presented to production, marketing, and scheduling executives, and helped make decisions that brought new show concepts to life. On my Amtrak rides to New York every Wednesday, I’ve never felt like I was dragging myself on the train, and I genuinely looked forward to work: I knew that I would learn and work on something new every day, and that felt more than fulfilling.However, this experience wouldn’t have been the same without my amazing research team and everyone I met across the networks, who made me feel like I was seen, heard, and part of something great. To my manager, Danielle Dicello, M.A. my team, David Schliecker Caitlin Rogers Abigail K. Aliya Shen, my best Food Network intern friend Vincent Snyder, and every single person I’ve met who coffee chatted with me, helped bring ideas to my projects, and invited me to see live production, I am nothing but grateful. THANK YOU for everything! ❤️ #wbdinterns",Irrelevant
